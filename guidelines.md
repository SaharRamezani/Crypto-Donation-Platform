# Crypto Donation Platform

Design and implement one or more smart contracts and a web interface to allow users to donate Sepolia ETH to charitable organizations.

## Brief description

- The users of your dApp can pay Sepolia ETH to fund charities; they can also propose new charities, which must be approved and added to the list only by the admin of your dApp (for example, the owner of the smart contract).

- Start from a pre-defined list of charitable organizations.

- The smart contract should keep a log of all donations, it might be the case of introducing events for this.

- The web interface can show a leaderboard for top donors.

- You will write the front-end to your smart contract.

- You can use the library of your choice to interact with the blockchain from the client. In class we have seen ethers.js, but other libraries are available.

- We do not expect incredible interfaces, just an operable interface to interact with your smart contract(s) without using Remix or the Sepolia Explorer.

- You will write one or more smart contracts. You can use Solidity and the Sepolia testnet or other programming languages and other testnets if you want to learn about other environments.

- If you work in pair, we expect a more sophisticated solution.
